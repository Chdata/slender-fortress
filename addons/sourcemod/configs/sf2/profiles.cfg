// Slender Fortress - Boss Profiles
//
// Here is where all data about a boss is put, such as their behavior, sanity increase/decrease rates, turnrate, animations, appear chance, etc.
// Some fields are required to be put in the profile data, but most of them are optional. All values involving time are in seconds unless stated otherwise.
// Not all fields are required to be written in a boss's profile. Optional fields will have a default value.
//
// Any sections ( {} ) abbrieviated with "sound_" will have its contents automatically precached and put in the server downloads table. Some of them also have several keyvalues that
// allows you to change how the sound is played in the game, including channel, pitch, volume, cooldown_min, and cooldown_max. Of course, they're all optional, but this 
// mostly only applies to boss type 2 sounds and proxy sounds.
// For example:

// 	"sound_chasingenemy"
//	{
//		"1"	"cof/slowerno/idle1.wav"
//		"2"	"cof/slowerno/idle2.wav"
//	}
//
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_min"	"1.5"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_cooldown_max"	"2.1"
//	"sound_chasingenemy_volume"	"0.7"

// Any other mentions of the word "section" involves sections of lines enclosed with braces ( {} ), like the example.

// Sections list their content one by one, each assigned by a number that increases as more content is inserted like the example. The content numbers HAVE to be in sequence,
// or else the gamemode might read a non-existent value and/or not be able to read that value at all. Some sections only support 1 content, which means no matter how much
// content you put into it only the first one will be read and used. They're noted in this guide.

// If you are familiar with VS. Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2, the mod_precache, mod_download, mat_download, and download sections works the same way. If you're not, there's more information
// about it below.
// Put the full path of a model or a material in mod_download or mat_download WITHOUT its extension, and all their associated extensions will be automatically be put into the downloads table.
// Any section that is prefixed with sound_ will automatically be precached and queued for downloading, so there's no need to put the sounds in a download section.

// ===================================================

// ===================================================
// These values are mandatory, however certain values depends on the type of the boss.

// "name" - An easy-to-read name of the boss. Can be utilized for menus, etc.

// "appear_chance_min" - The lowest float value the chance can be.
// "appear_chance_max" - The highest float value the chance can be.
