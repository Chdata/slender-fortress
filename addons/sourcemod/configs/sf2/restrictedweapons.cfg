// Slender Fortress - Restricted Weapons Config
//
// Weapons are restricted by ITEM DEFINITION INDEX, which can be retrieved from the scripts/items/items_game.txt file.
// Player's weapons will instead be replaced with their stock weapon. 

// NOTE: This only applies for RED team while they're in-game, or for BLU when they're in Proxy mode. This will have no effect
// if the player is in PvP mode or does not fit in any of the above conditions.

// Insert the weapon's item definition index into one of these categories (by class):
// scout
// sniper
// soldier
// demoman
// heavy
// heavyweapons (just for consistency, but "heavy" works too)
// medic
// pyro
// spy
// engineer

// Or if you want to restrict a certain weapon for all classes, insert the definition index into the "all" section instead.

// Set the item definition index's value to "1" to restrict it, "0" to disable.
